This is a place for me to collect and collate interesting articles related to distributed systems, algorithms, tooling, etc.

## Distributed Systems ##
* [Apache Kafka, Samza, and the Unix Philosophy of Distributed Data](http://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-samza-and-the-unix-philosophy-of-distributed-data) by [Martin Kleppmann](https://twitter.com/martinkl) - a very good introduction to the [Samza](https://samza.apache.org/)/[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) approach to stream processing with particular attention to how this approach relates to the Unix philosophy of small, stand-alone, interchangable tools.  
* [The world beyond batch: Streaming 101](http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/08/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101.html) by [Tyler Akidau](http://twitter.com/takidau). A medium length introduction the fundamental concepts of stream processing by one of the authors of Google's in-house solution, [MillWheel](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41378.pdf).  This is an excellent introduction for those completely new to stream processing. The two biggest take-aways are that stream processing systems that do not provide a consistent view of the data should not be trusted and that for time-based computation, event-time windows, while the most difficult to achieve, are the only approach worth pursuing.
